## Where everything landed

**Route: nothing.** Every finding I hold is closed, parked with a reason, or
blocked.

| area | final state |
|---|---|
| **Pattern #1 / masonry density** | **CLEAN**, by declaration and by measurement. 109 stamped faces, 0 matching neither dimension, like-for-like junction disagreements **0** |
| **Sidewalk encroachment** | **CLOSED.** Tightest walk in the world **0.89 → 1.15 m**; sub-1.20 m stretches **15 → 3** |
| **The user's ~45 requests** | **All graded.** Last NOT DONE (wheel arches) closed at `6333004c`. One blocked |
| **Interiors as a set** | Wall thickness **0.18 m in all eight**. Ceiling spread 0.90 → 0.80 m. Keepers **4 of 8 → 8 of 8** |
| **Floats** | One real float in the world at Round 3 (thrift price card) — **now gone** |
| **Seams in new ground** | Side street + park far half swept at grazing angles. 8 shot, 3 read, nothing found |

**Blocked (1):** the bench ad — a failed *search*, not a failed shot. No
ad-panel geometry exists anywhere by shape. Located as *the stop in front of
LIQUOR*. Needs its owner. See `BLOCKED-AUDIT-seams.md`.

## Risk — read this part

**I published two wrong findings on this branch.** Both are retracted in place,
with the measurements that killed them:

1. **"42 of 109 masonry faces disagree with their stamp"** and **"135 of 239
   junctions disagree"** — a `BoxGeometry` has four side faces and I measured
   every one against `parameters.width`. Mainline diagnosed it (`7fe644b9`)
   *before* my retraction landed. My own first repair was **circular** — it
   picked whichever dimension matched the declaration, so it could never report
   a mismatch; mainline's material-index version replaced it.
2. **"raising the casino ceiling stranded three fittings"** — they are hung off
   `room.H` deliberately, and the source says so at `int-casino.ts:361`. I had
   documented that exact false-positive class one round earlier.

Both were caught by **reading the source**, not by measuring harder. Anything on
this branch resting on a measurement without a source check should be treated as
provisional.

## The through-line, if only one thing is kept

Every instrument I built that tried to infer **what a thing is** from its shape
has eventually been wrong — the geometric masonry filter, the door-leaf filter
that returned citizens, the float detector that returned lamp bulbs, the box
face. Every one was fixed by the world **declaring** something instead:
`userData.mod`, `userData.masonry`, `__frontages`, `declareDoorWorld`.

> **An auditor outside the code can measure what a thing looks like. It cannot
> reliably infer what a thing is.** The declarations added this session are worth
> more than everything I found with them.

Two secondary rules that earned their place:

- *An unread screenshot is not an observation* — now `GOTCHAS.md` §20 — **and a
  read screenshot is not an observation of what you aimed at.** Five of six of
  my early frames were pointed at nothing.
- *Establishing that a defect is real is not the same as establishing that it
  matters.* I carried the 12 mirrored pennants for eight rounds before asking
  whether they were visible. They are not: the art is a symmetric triangle.

Nothing assigned. Queue `## Now` items are all worked; `## Next` (pattern #1) is
closed clean. One blocked item above.
